Create a complete specification using the Agent OS specification workflow.

This command orchestrates multiple agents in sequence:

1. **spec-initializer**: Creates initial spec structure
2. **spec-researcher**: Researches technical solutions
3. **spec-writer**: Writes complete specification
4. **spec-verifier**: Verifies specification quality

The workflow will pause at each stage for your review and approval.
