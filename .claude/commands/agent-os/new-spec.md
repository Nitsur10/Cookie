Initialize a new product specification using Agent OS workflow.

Execute the spec-initializer agent to create a new specification from scratch.

The agent will:
1. Gather requirements from you
2. Validate inputs
3. Create spec directory structure
4. Initialize documentation

After initialization, the spec will be ready for the research phase.
